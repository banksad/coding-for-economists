<p>In this chapter, you’ll find out about how to get the basic tools you need to code set up on your own computer. While you don’t need to know all of this if you’re planning on using the ‘Google Colab’ or ‘Binder’ options to run code examples from the book, you may find it helpful to read through this chapter anyway.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.1. </span>Operating system<a class="headerlink" href="#operating-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Almost all of the code you’ll see can be run on all three of the major operating systems: Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet decided which operating system to use, I recommend either Linux or MacOS because, in a very small number of cases, your code, third party packages and libraries, and coding related tools like Docker, either won’t work at all on Windows or will be <em>much</em> more difficult to set up. (Don’t panic if you have Windows already: we’ll come to a workaround in a moment.) Although it is rare that you run into a case like this, it’s just often enough for it to be a real pain. Furthermore, if you ever need to scale up your work to the cloud, you’ll find that it’s more cost effective to use machines that have use an operating system closer to Linux (which MacOS is). While Macs are famous for being expensive, most Linux distributions are free, so you should be able to find a code-friendly operating system to satisfy any budget constraint. Linux used to have a reputation as being fearsomely difficult for beginners. But modern Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, are pretty user-friendly.</p>
<p>If you are using Windows, then a good workaround for some of these issues is to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://pbpython.com/wsl-python.html"><em>Windows Subsystem for Linux</em></a>. It’s essentially a Linux operating system that installs alongside and integrates with your existing Windows operating system. This allows you to run code as if you were using Linux. You can get WSL <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">for free from Microsoft</a>.</p>

<p>This book uses Python, which is usually ranked as the first or second most popular programming language in the world and, just as importantly, it’s also one of the easiest to learn. It’s a general purpose language, which means it can perform a wide range of tasks. This combination of features is why people say Python has a low floor and a high ceiling. It’s also very versatile; the joke goes that Python is the 2nd best language at everything, and there’s some truth to that (although Python is 1st best at some tasks, like machine learning). But a language that covers such a lot of ground is also very useful; and Python is widely used across industry, academia, and the public sector. Python is the main ‘dynamic’ language used at <a class="reference external" href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Google</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://insights.dice.com/2020/12/01/7-programming-languages-popular-at-apple-that-could-land-you-a-job/">most demanded language</a> in jobs for Apple. It is used for everything from computer games to websites, data science to software applications: it’s even being used to help <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nasa/fprime">fly a helicopter on Mars</a>. As an economist, you will know that this means Python benefits from strong positive network externalities. As such, learning Python has a lot of value and, once you have, learning more specialised languages like C++ or R is much easier; many of the basic programming concepts you’ll see in this book are useful in almost any programming language.</p>

<p>Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses. Python and Julia are so-called high-level languages that are easier to write code in. C++ and Fortran are more low-level languages and much more fussy and labour-intensive to write code in; but, once the code is written (and ‘compiled’), it runs <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>Another big difference between languages is the extent to which users have created software that extends the base functionality of the language. The ecosystem of other users, and what they’re using the language for, is really important for determining how useful a language is. For example, Python and R have vibrant data science communities producing extensions (called libraries or packages) that are what really make those languages so useful for data science (far more than the base functionality of either).</p>
<p>Programming languages come in versions, which can be quite different, and some of the most important functionality of programming languages is provided by add-ons called packages or libraries, which themselves have versions. To make matters worse, not all versions of packages and languages will work together, and the combinations that work may depend on your operating system (Windows, Mac, etc)!</p>
<p>The combination of the language and its version (eg Python 3.6.1), the packages and their versions (eg numpy 1.19), and the operating system the code is being run on (eg MacOS Catalina) is called the computational environment.</p>
<p>To programme, you will need two things on your computer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>an installation of the programming language</p></li>
<li><p>a way to write and run scripts, using an integrated development environment (IDE)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.3. </span>Installing Python<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Note that if you are going to use Google Colab or Binder to run code examples, both of these come with Python installed. These instructions are just for installing Python on your own computer.</p>
<p>Download the individual edition of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda distribution</a> of Python for your operating system and install it (on Anaconda’s website, this is currently found under Products -&gt; Individual Edition). This will provide you with a Python installation and a host of the most useful libraries.</p>
<p>Anaconda might ask whether you want to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable. Your PATH variable is a list of where programmes are located on your computer that <em>other</em> programmes can see. By adding Anaconda to your PATH, you will be able to more easily launch applications that make use of Python.</p>
<p>You can confirm that you’ve set up Anaconda correctly by following the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/">verify installation instructions</a> on the Anaconda website. Python and Anaconda are available on all major operating systems.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.4. </span>Installing an integrated development environment (IDE)<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-an-integrated-development-environment-ide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An integrated development environment is a software application that provides a few tools to make coding easier. The most important of these is a way to write the code itself! IDEs are not the only way to programme, but they are perhaps the most useful. If you have used <strong>Stata</strong> or <strong>Matlab</strong>, you may not have realised it, but these package up the language and the IDE together. But they are separate things: the language is a way of processing your instructions, the IDE is where you write those instructions.</p>
<p>Here are some of the useful features an IDE might have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a way to run your code interactively (line-by-line) or all at once</p></li>
<li><p>a way to debug (look for errors) in your code</p></li>
<li><p>a quick way to access helpful information about commonly used software packages</p></li>
<li><p>automatic code formatting, so that your code follows best practice guidelines</p></li>
<li><p>auto-completion of your code</p></li>
<li><p>automatic code checking for basic errors</p></li>
</ul>
<p>People have strong feelings about which IDE they prefer. I strongly recommend <a class="reference external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, a free and open source IDE from Microsoft that is available on all major operating systems. Just like Python itself, Visual Studio can be extended with packages, and it is those packages, called extensions in this case, that make it so useful. Visual Studio Code is available on all major operating systems.</p>
<p>Another IDE that you might find useful from time to time is <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Lab</a>, which runs in a browser window. It is designed around ‘Jupyter’ notebooks (with the extension ‘.ipynb’), which mix code and text, rather than scripts, which are predominantly code (and have extension ‘.py’). The name, ‘Jupyter’, is a reference to the three original languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python, and R, and to Galileo’s notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter. Jupyter notebooks now support a vast number of languages beyond the original three, including Ruby, Haskell, Go, Scala, Octave, Java, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels">more</a>. There’ll be more about the difference between scripts and notebooks later on in the book, for now though, we’ll keep our focus on scripts and Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>Download and install Visual Studio Code. If you need some help, see this <a class="reference external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial">very short tutorial</a> on setting it up from Microsoft (ignore the bits about debugging and installing packages).</p>
<p>Once you have Visual Studio Code installed and opened, navigate to the ‘extensions’ tab on the left hand side navigation bar. You’ll need to install the following extensions, which you can search for by using the text box:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Python</p></li>
<li><p>Pylance</p></li>
<li><p>Jupyter</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have installed these and Python then you are ready to run your first script!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-your-first-code-hello-world">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Running your first code: Hello World!<a class="headerlink" href="#running-your-first-code-hello-world" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now you will create and run your first code. If you get stuck, there’s a more in-depth tutorial over at the <a class="reference external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial">VS Code documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Create a new folder for your work (perhaps named ‘codingforeconomists’, no white space), open that folder with Visual Studio Code and create a new file, naming it <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello_world.py</span></code>. The file extension, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code>, is very important as it implicitly tells Visual Studio Code that this is a Python script. In the Visual Studio Code editor, add a single line to the file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello World!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Save the file.</p>
<p>If you named this file with the extension <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code> then VS Code will recognise that it is Python code and you should see the name and version of Python pop up in the blue bar at the bottom of your VS Code window. Make sure that the version of Python displayed here is the Anaconda version that you just installed rather than one that comes built-in with your operating system (this is particularly an issue on Mac). To change which Python version your code uses, click on the version shown in the blue bar and select the version you want. If you’re using a fresh Anaconda install it will probably say <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">(base)</span></code> or similar words on the version you want. If you’ve just changed Python version, it can be a good idea to restart VS Code.</p>
<p>When you press save, you may get messages about installing extra packages or making Pylance your default language server; just go with VS Code’s suggestions here, except the one about the terminal, which you can say no to.</p>
<p>Alright, shall we actually run some code? Select/highlight the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print('Hello</span> <span class="pre">world!')</span></code> text you typed in the file and right-click to bring up some options including ‘Run Selection/Line in Terminal’ and `Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window’. Because VS Code is a richly featured IDE, there are lots of options for how to run the file. Let’s try both of the main ways: the terminal and the interactive window.</p>
<p>To run the code in the <strong>terminal</strong>, right-click and select ‘Run Python file in terminal’. This will bring up a new panel (called a terminal) <em>within</em> Visual Studio Code that runs your entire script from top to bottom-and you should see ‘Hello World!’ pop up!</p>
<p>The other way of working, with the interactive window, will be much more familiar to anyone who has used Stata or Matlab and is much more suited to the way economists tend to work because it doesn’t require you to write the whole script, start to finish, ahead of time. Instead, you can jam, changing code as you go, (re-)running it line by line. To run the code in an interactive window, <strong>right-click and select ‘Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window’</strong>. This should cause a new ‘interactive’ panel to appear within Visual Studio Code, and only the selected line will execute within it.</p>
<p>At this point, you may see a message about Visual Studio Code’s default behaviour when you press shift+return; for this book, it’s good to have shift+return default to running a line in the interactive window.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Making code run in the interactive window by default</p>
<p>Open up Visual Studio Code and go to settings (click on the cog in the bottom left-hand corner, then click settings).</p>
<p>Type ‘python send’ into the search box. Depending on your configuration and Visual Studio Code version, you will either see ‘Python › Data Science: Send Selection To Interactive Window’ or ‘Jupyter: Send Selection To Interactive Window’. Make sure that there is a tick in the box.</p>
<p>This will ensure that when you hit shift+enter on code scripts, it will execute your code in Visual Studio’s interactive window (starting a new window if necessary).</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s make more use of the interactive window. At the bottom of it, there is a box that says ‘Type code here and press shift-enter to run’. Go ahead and type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print('Hello</span> <span class="pre">World!')</span></code> directly in there to achieve the same effect as running the line from your script. Also, any variables you run in the interactive window (from your script or directly by entering them in the box) will persist.</p>
<p>To see how variables persist, type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello_string</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">'Hello</span> <span class="pre">World!'</span></code> into the interactive window’s code entry box and hit shift-enter. If you now type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello_string</span></code> and hit shift+enter, you will see the contents of the variable you just created. You can also click the grid symbol at the top of the interactive window (between the stop symbol and the save file symbol); this is the variable explorer and will pop open a panel showing all of the variables you’ve created in this interactive session. You should see one called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello_string</span></code> of type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code> with a value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Hello</span> <span class="pre">World!</span></code>.</p>
<p>This shows the two ways of working with the interactive window–running (segments) from a script, or writing code directly in the entry box.</p>
<div class="admonition-exercise admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise</p>
<p>Create a new script that, when run, prints “Welcome to coding for economists” and run it in both the terminal and an interactive window.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.3.1. </span>The terminal in brief<a class="headerlink" href="#the-terminal-in-brief" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the section above, I mentioned the <em>terminal</em>, also known as the <em>command line</em>. This is a text-based way to issue all kinds of commands to your computer (not just Python commands) and knowing a little bit about it is really useful for coding (and more) because managing packages, environments (which we haven’t yet discussed), and version control (ditto) can all be done via the terminal. We’ll come to these in due course, but for now, a little background on what the terminal is and what it does.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>To open up the command line within Visual Studio Code, use the <kbd>⌃</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> keyboard shortcut (Mac) or <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> (Windows/Linux), or click “View &gt; Terminal”.</p>
</div>
<p>Firstly, everything you can do by clicking on icons to launch programmes on your computer, you can also do via the terminal, also known as the command line. For many programmes, a lot of their functionality can be accessed using the command line, and other programmes <em>only</em> have a command line interface (CLI), including some that are used for data science.</p>
<p>Use Visual Studio Code to open a terminal window by clicking Terminal -&gt; New Terminal on the list of commands at the very top of the window. If you have installed the Anaconda distribution of Python, your terminal should look something like this as your ‘command prompt’:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>base<span class="o">)</span> your-username@your-computer current-directory %
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>on Mac, and the same but with ‘%’ replaced by ‘$’ on linux, and</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>base<span class="o">)</span> C:<span class="se">\U</span>sers<span class="se">\Y</span>ourUsername&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>on Windows. If you don’t see the word <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(base)</span></code> at the start of the line, you may need to type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">activate</span></code> first.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(base)</span></code> part is saying that your current Python environment is the base one (later, we’ll see how to add others for reproducibility and to isolate projects). Unfortunately, and confusingly, the commands that you can use in the terminal on Mac and Linux, on the one hand, and Windows, on the other, are different. This won’t be much of an issue in practice.</p>
<p>For now, to at least try out the command line, let’s use something that works across all three of the major operating systems. Type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code> on the command prompt that came up in your new terminal window. If you installed Python, and put it on your PATH, you should see information about your installation of Python appear, including the version, followed by a Python prompt that looks like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>. This is a kind of interactive Python session, in the terminal. It’s much less rich than the one available in Visual Studio Code (it can’t run scripts, for example) but you can try <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print('Hello</span> <span class="pre">World!')</span></code> and it will run, printing your message. To exit the terminal-based Python session, type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exit()</span></code> to go back to the regular command line.</p>
<p>If you’re using a bash or zsh terminal, there are a couple of commands that are so essential it would be remiss <em>not</em> to mention them. One is to list the contents of the current directory, for which the command is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code>. The other is to move directory, for which the command is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span></code>. If you find that you’ve opened a terminal you can always get a sense of where you are from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> and move to where you need to be using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">directory/</span></code>. One of the advantages of opening a folder in Visual Studio Code and then opening a terminal with Code using ‘New Terminal’ is that the terminal will open in the folder you’re working in (which is usually where you want to be).</p>

<div class="section" id="installing-packages">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.3.2. </span>Installing packages<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The default installation of Anaconda comes with many of the packages you’ll need, but it won’t be long before you’ll need to install some extra ones. Extra packages, for example for regression, deliver a lot of the value of a programming language. You may sometimes hear that Python is a ‘batteries included’ programming language, meaning that the base language is very rich. This is definitely true! But even so, for economics, we’ll extend it further in numerous ways.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>The command line interacts with your operating system and is used to create, activate, or change python installations.</p>
</div>
<p>To install extra Python packages, there are two options, and both use the command line. You’ll need to have conda activated before installing a package–if you don’t see the name of an environment, eg <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(base)</span></code>, at the start of your terminal’s line, use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">activate</span></code> command first. Once you have activated the conda environment, you install packages using another command.</p>
<p>For very widely used packages, you can often use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">packagename</span></code>. Anaconda provide pre-built packages that are convenient for a host of reasons. If there isn’t a pre-built Anaconda version of the package available, you can fall back on installing via pip using</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install packagename
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In true programming-humour style, pip is a recursive acronym that stands for ‘pip install packages’. By default, packages are installed into your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">base</span></code> Python environment.</p>
<p>Here’s a full example of the commands used to install the <strong>pandas</strong> package into the base environment:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>your-username@your-computer current-directory % conda activate
<span class="o">(</span>base<span class="o">)</span> your-username@your-computer current-directory % conda install pandas
</pre></div>

<p>If you just want to get on with some coding, feel free to skip this section.</p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded <em>Visual Studio Code</em> and installed some basic extensions - Python, Pylance, and Jupyter - you’ll have enough to get going but VS Code can do a whole lot more with some extra add ons. You can install these using the extensions tab on the left hand side of VS Code. Here are the ones I recommend and why:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Markdown extensions - markdown is a simple text language that is often used to provide readmes for code repositories. It comes with the file extension .md</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Markdown All in One</em>, to help writing Markdown docs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Markdown Preview Enhanced</em>, to view rendered markdown as you type it (right click and select ‘Open Preview…’).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Coding extensions</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Bracket Pair Colorizer 2</em>, which allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. Very useful when you have nested methods!</p></li>
<li><p><em>indent-rainbow</em>, gives different levels of indentation different colours for ease of reading.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Path Intellisense</em>, autocompletes filenames in code.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Version control</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Git History</em>, view and search your git log along and show a graph of git commits with details.</p></li>
<li><p><em>GitLens</em>, helps to visualise code authorship at a glance via ‘Git blame’ annotations, navigate and explore Git repositories, and more.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Code Spell Checker</em>, does exactly what it says, really useful for avoiding mangled variable name errors. To ensure it uses ‘British English’, change the ‘C Spell: Language’ text from ‘en’ to ‘en-GB’ in VS Code’s settings. Other languages are available as separate extensions.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>General</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Rainbow CSV</em>, uses colour to make plain old CSV files much more readable in VS Code.</p></li>
<li><p><em>vscode-icons</em>, intelligent icons for your files as seen in the VS Code file explorer, eg a folder called data gets an icon showing a disc drive superimposed onto a folder.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>LaTex - it’s a bit of surprise, but VS Code is one of the best LaTeX editors out there: if not <em>the</em> best. You will need LaTeX installed already though and initial setup of a compilation ‘recipe’ is a bit fiddly (though, once it works, it’s dreamy).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>LaTeX Workshop</em>, provides core features for LaTeX typesetting with Visual Studio Code.</p></li>
<li><p><em>LaTeX Preview</em>, both in-line and side-by-side previews of LaTeX code. A really fantastic extension.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as adding extra extensions, you can customise the default settings of VS Code. As mentioned before, you’ll probably want to change the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jupyter.sendSelectionToInteractiveWindow</span></code> setting to True. The easiest way to do this is to go to Settings (the cog icon) and type in ‘Jupyter: Send Selection’, and you should see a tick box come up; make sure it’s ticked.</p>
<p>Another useful one for coding is to change the ‘Editor: Render Whitespace’ setting, aka <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">editor.renderWhitespace</span></code> from ‘selection’ to ‘boundary’. This will now show any boundary whitespace, or more than one instance of whitespace contiguously, as a grey dot. This might seem odd but it’s really useful because the wrong amount of whitespace can create problems with code.</p>

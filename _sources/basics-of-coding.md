# Basics of coding

## Variables and types

Creating a variable in Python is achieved via an assignment. It's simpler than it sounds:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = 10
print(a)
```

This creates a variable `a`, assigns the value 10 to it, and prints it. Sometimes you will hear variables referred to as *objects*. Everything that is not a literal value, such as `10`, is an object. In the above example, `a` is an object that has been assigned the value `10`.

How about this:

```{code-cell} ipython3
b = 'This is a string'
print(b)
```

It's the same thing but with a different **type** of data, a string instead of an integer. Python is *dynamically typed*, which you means it will guess what type of variable you're creating as you create it. This has pros and cons, with the main pro being that it makes for more concise code.

```{admonition} Important
Everything is an object, and every object has a type.
```

The most basic built-in data types that you'll need to know about are: integers `10`, floats `1.23`, strings `like this`, booleans `True`, and nothing `None`. Python also has a built-in types called a list `[10, 15, 20]` that can contain anything, even *different* types. So

```{code-cell} ipython3
list_example = [10, 1.23, 'like this', True, None]
print(list_example)
```

is completely valid code. As well as the built-in types, packages can define their own custom types.

If you ever want to check the type of a Python variable, you can call the `type` function on it like so:

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(list_example)
```

## Lists and slicing

Lists are a really useful way to work with lots of data at once. They're defined with square brackets, with entries separated by commas. You can also construct them by appending entries:

```{code-cell} ipython3
list_example.append('one more entry')
print(list_example)
```

And you can access earlier entries using an index, which begins at 0 and ends at one less than the length of the list (this is the convention in many programming languages). For instance, to print specific entries at the start, using `0`, and end, using `-1`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(list_example[0])
print(list_example[-1])
```

As well as accessing positions in lists using indexing, you can use *slices* on lists. This uses the colon character, `:`, to stand in for 'from the beginning' or 'until the end' (when only appearing once). For instance, to print just the last two entries, we would use the index `-2:` to mean from the second-to-last onwards. If we just want the first and last three entries to be printed, we can use:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(list_example[:3])
print(list_example[-3:])
```

Slicing can be even more elaborate than that because we can jump entries using a second colon. Here's a full example that begins at the second entry (remember the index starts at 0), runs up until the second-to-last entry (exclusive), and jumps every other entry inbetween (range just produces a list of numbers):

```{code-cell} ipython3
list_of_numbers = list(range(1, 11))
start = 1
stop = -1
step = 2
print(list_of_numbers[start:stop:step])
```

A handy trick is that you can reverse a list entirely using this:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(list_of_numbers[::-1])
```

## Operators

All of the basic operators you see in mathematics are available to use: `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, `**` for powers, `/` for division, and `%` for modulo. These work as you'd expect on numbers. But these operators are sometimes defined for other built-in data types too. For instance, we can 'sum' strings (which really concatenates them):

```{code-cell} ipython3
string_one = 'This is an example '
string_two = 'of string concatenation'
string_full = string_one + string_two
print(string_full)
```

It works for lists too:

```{code-cell} ipython3
list_one = ['apples', 'oranges']
list_two = ['pears', 'satsumas']
list_full = list_one + list_two
print(list_full)
```

Perhaps more surprisingly, you can multiply strings!

```{code-cell} ipython3
string = 'apples, '
print(string*3)
```

## Strings

In some ways, strings are treated a bit like lists, meaning you can access the individual characters via slicing and indexing. For example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
string = 'cheesecake'
print(string[-4:])
```

Both lists and strings will also allow you to use the `len` command to get their length:

```{code-cell} ipython3
string = 'cheesecake'
print('String has length:')
print(len(string))
list_of_numbers = range(1, 20)
print('List of numbers has length:')
print(len(list_of_numbers))
```

There are various functions built into Python to help you work with strings that are particularly useful for cleaning messy data. For example, imagine you have a variable name like 'This Is /A Variable   '. (You may think this is implausibly bad; I only wish that were true). Let's see if we can clean this up:

```{code-cell} ipython3
string = 'This Is /A Variable   '
string = string.replace('/', '').rstrip().lower()
print(string)
```

The steps above replace the character '/', strip out whitespace on the right hand-side of the string, and put everything in lower case. The brackets after the words signify that a function has been applied; we'll see more of functions later.

You'll often want to output one type of data as another, and Python generally knows what you're trying to achieve if you, for example, `print` a boolean value. For numbers, there are more options and you can see a big list of advice on string formatting of all kinds of things [here](https://pyformat.info/). For now, let's just see a simple example of something called an f-string, a string that combines a number and a string (these begin with an `f` for formatting):

```{code-cell} ipython3
value = 20
sqrt_val = 20**0.5
print(f'The square root of {value:d} is {sqrt_val:.2f}')
```

The formatting command `:d` is an instruction to treat `value` like an integer, while `:.2f` is an instruction to print it like a float with 2 decimal places.

```{note}
f-strings are only available in Python 3.6+
```

## Booleans and conditions

Some of the most important operations you will perform are with True and False values, also known as boolean data types. First, these behave as you'd expect: `True and False` evaluates to `False`, while `True or False` evaluates to `True`. There's also the `not` keyword. For example

```{code-cell} ipython3
not True
```

as you might expect.

Conditions are expressions that evaluate as booleans. A simple example is `10 == 20`. The `==` is yet another operator that compares the objects on either side and returns `True` if they have the same *values*--though be careful using it with different data types. The opposite of `==` is `!=`, which you can read as 'not equal to the value of'. Here's an example of `==`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
boolean_condition = (10 == 20)
print(boolean_condition)
```

The real power of conditions comes when we start to use them in more complex examples. Some of the keywords that evaluate conditions are `if`, `else`, `and`, `or`, `in`, `not`, and `is`. Here's

```{code-cell} ipython3
name = 'Ada'
score = 99

if name == 'Ada' and score > 90:
    print('Ada, you achieved a high score.')

if name == 'Smith' or score > 90:
    print('You could be called Smith or have a high score')

if name != 'Smith' and score > 90:
    print('You are not called Smith and you have a high score')

```

All three of these conditions evaluate as True, and so all three messages get printed. Given that `==` and `!=` test for equality and not equal, respectively, you may be wondering what the keywords `is` and `not` are for. Remember that everything in Python is an object, and that values can be assigned to objects. `==` and `!=` compare *values*, while `is` and `not` compare *objects`*. For example,

```{code-cell} ipython3
name_list = ['Ada', 'Adam']
name_list_two = ['Ada', 'Adam']

# Compare values
print(name_list == name_list_two)

# Compare objects
print(name_list is name_list_two)
```

One of the most useful conditional keywords is `in`. I must use this one ten times a day to pick out a variable or make sure something is where it's supposed to be.

```{code-cell} ipython3
name_list = ['Lovelace', 'Smith', 'Pigou', 'Babbage']

print('Lovelace' in name_list)

print('Bob' in name_list)
```

The opposite is `not in`.

Finally, one conditional construct you're bound to use at *some* point, is the `if`...`else` structure:

```{code-cell} ipython3
score = 98

if score == 100:
    print('Top marks!')
elif score>90 and score<100:
    print('High score!')
elif score>10 and score<=90:
    pass
else:
    print('Better luck next time.')
```

Note that this does nothing if the score is between 11 and 90, and prints a message otherwise.

## Loops and list comprehensions

A loop is a way of executing a similar piece of code over and over in a similar way. The most useful loops are `for` loops and list comprehensions.

A `for` loop does something *for* the time that the condition is satisfied. For example,

```{code-cell} ipython3
name_list = ['Lovelace', 'Smith', 'Pigou', 'Babbage']

for name in name_list:
    print(name)

```

prints out a name until all names have been printed out. A useful trick with for loops is the `enumerate` keyword, which runs through an index that keeps track of the items in a list:

```{code-cell} ipython3
name_list = ['Lovelace', 'Smith', 'Hopper', 'Babbage']

for i, name in enumerate(name_list):
    print(f'The name in position {i} is {name}')

```

High-level languages like Python and R do not get *compiled* into highly performant machine code ahead of being run, unlike C++ and FORTRAN. What this means is that although they are much less unwieldy to use, some types of operation can be very slow--ans `for` loops are particularly cumbersome. (Although you may not notice this unless you're working on a bigger computation.)

But there is a way around this, and it's with something called a *list comprehension*. These can combine what a `for` loop and a `condition` do in a single line of efficiently executable code. Say we had a list of numbers and wanted to filter it according to whether the numbers divided by 3 or not:

```{code-cell} ipython3
number_list = range(1, 40)
divide_list = [x for x in number_list if x % 3 == 0]
print(divide_list)
```

Or if we only wanted to pick out names that end in 'Smith':

```{code-cell} ipython3
names_list = ['Joe Bloggs', 'Adam Smith', 'Sandra Noone', 'leonara smith']
smith_list = [x for x in names_list if 'smith' in x.lower()]
print(smith_list)
```

Note how we used 'smith' rather than 'Smith' and then used `lower()` to ensure we matched names regardless of the case they are written in. We can even do a whole `if` ... `else` construct *inside* a list comprehension:

```{code-cell} ipython3
names_list = ['Joe Bloggs', 'Adam Smith', 'Sandra Noone', 'leonara smith']
smith_list = [x if 'smith' in x.lower() else 'Not Smith!' for x in names_list]
print(smith_list)
```

Many of the constructs we've seen can be combined. For instance, there is no reason why we can't have a nested or repeated list comprehension, and, perhaps more surprisingly, sometimes these are useful!

```{code-cell} ipython3
first_names = ['Ada', 'Adam', 'Grace', 'Charles']
last_names = ['Lovelace', 'Smith', 'Hopper', 'Babbage']
names_list = [x + ' ' + y for x, y in zip(first_names, last_names)]
print(names_list)
```

The `zip` keyword is doing this magic; think of it like a zipper, bringing an element of each list together in turn.

Finally, an even more extreme use of list comprehensions can deliver nested structures:

```{code-cell} ipython3
first_names = ['Ada', 'Adam']
last_names = ['Lovelace', 'Smith']
names_list = [[x + ' ' + y for x in first_names] for y in last_names]
print(names_list)
```

This gives a nested structure that (in this case) iterates over `first_names` first, and then `last_names`.

## Functions

If you're an economist, I hardly need to tell you what a function is. In coding, it's much the same as in mathematics: a function has inputs, it performs its function, and it returns any outputs. Functions begin with a `def` keyword for 'define a function'. The body of the function is then indented relative to the left-most text. Function arguments are defined in brackets following the name, with different inputs separated by commas. Any outputs are given with the `return` keyword, again with different variables separated by commas. Let's see a very simple example:

```{code-cell} ipython3

def welcome_message(name):
    return f'Hello {name}, and welcome!'

# Without indentation, this code is not part of function
name = 'Ada'
output_string = welcome_message(name)
print(output_string)
```

One powerful feature of functions is that we can define defaults for the input arguments. Let's see that in action by defining a default value for `name`, along with multiple outputs--a hello message and a score.

```{code-cell} ipython3

def score_message(score, name='student'):
    """This is a doc-string, a string describing a function.
    Args:
        score (float): Raw score
        name (str): Name of student
    Returns:
        str: A hello message.
        float: A normalised score.
    """
    norm_score = (score-50)/10
    return f'Hello {name}', norm_score

# Without indentation, this code is not part of function
name = 'Ada'
score = 98
# No name entered
print(score_message(score))
# Name entered
print(score_message(score, name=name))
```

In that last example, you'll notice that I added some text to the function. This is a doc-string. It's there to help users (and, most likely, future you) to understand what the function does. Let's see how this works in action by calling `help` on the `score_message` function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
help(score_message)
```

## Dictionaries

Another built-in Python type that is enormously useful is the *dictionary*. This provides a mapping one set of variables to another (either one-to-one or many-to-one). Let's see an example of defining a dictionary and using it:

```{code-cell} ipython3
fruit_dict = {'Jazz': 'Apple', 'Owari': 'Satsuma', 'Seto': 'Satsuma',
              'Pink Lady': 'Apple'}

# Add an entry
fruit_dict.update({'Cox': 'Apple'})

variety_list = ['Jazz', 'Jazz', 'Seto', 'Cox']

fruit_list = [fruit_dict[x] for x in variety_list]
print(fruit_list)
```

From an input list of varieties, we get an output list of their associated fruits. Another good trick to know with dictionaries is that you can iterate through their keys and values:

```{code-cell} ipython3

for key, value in fruit_dict.items():
    print(key + ' maps into ' + value)

```

## How packages and modules work

We already saw how to install package work in the previous chapter.

## Splat and splatty-splat

You read those right, yes. These are also known as unpacking operators for, respectively, arguments and dictionaries. For instance, if I have a function that takes two arguments I can send variables to it in different ways:

```{code-cell} ipython3

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(5, 10))

func_args = (6, 11)

print(add(*func_args))
```

The splat operator, `*`, unpacks the variable `func_args` into two different function arguments. Splatty-splat unpacks dictionaries into keyword arguments:

```{code-cell} ipython3

def function_with_kwargs(a, x=0, y=0, z=0):
    return a + x + y + z

print(function_with_kwargs(5))

kwargs = {'x': 3, 'y': 4, 'z': 5}

print(function_with_kwargs(5, **kwargs))
```

Perhaps most surprisingly of all, we can use the splat operator *in the definition of a function*. For example:

```{code-cell} ipython3

def sum_elements(*elements):
    return sum(*elements)

nums = (1, 2, 3)

print(sum_elements(nums))

more_nums = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

print(sum_elements(more_nums))
```

## Miscellaneous

Here are some other bits of basic coding that might be useful. They really show why Python is such a delightful language.

You can use unicode characters for variables

```{code-cell} ipython3

α = 15
β = 30

print(α/β)
```

You can swap variables in a single assignment:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = 10
b = 'This is a string'

a, b = b, a

print(a)
```

You can sum elements in a list:

```{code-cell} ipython3
fruit_list = [2, 27, -4, 0]
sum(fruit_list)
```

**iterools** offers counting, repeating, cycling, chaining, and slicing. Here's a cycling example that uses the `next` keyword to get the next iteraction:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from itertools import cycle

lorrys = ['red lorry', 'yellow lorry']
lorry_iter = cycle(lorrys)

print(next(lorry_iter))
print(next(lorry_iter))
print(next(lorry_iter))
print(next(lorry_iter))
```

**iterools** also offers products, combinations, combinations with replacement, and permutations. Here are the combinations of 'abc' of length 2:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from itertools import combinations
print(combinations('abc', 2))
```

Find out what the date is! (Can pass a timezone as an argument.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
from datetime import date

print(date.today())
```

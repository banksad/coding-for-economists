    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapter was just a quick tour of what can be done with a single tabular dataset (a 'dataframe'). In this chapter, we'll go deeper into working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to extract, clean, and analyse data is one of the core skills any economist needs. Fortunately, the (open source) tools that are available for data analysis have improved enormously in recent years, and working with them can be a delight--even the most badly formatted data can be beaten into shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll get really good introduction to the [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package, the core data manipulation library in Python. The name is derived from 'panel data' but it's suited to any tabular data, and can be used to work with more complex data structures too. We *won't* cover reading in or writing data here; see the next chapter for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is hugely indebted to the fantastic [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake Vanderplas. Remember, if you get stuck with pandas, there is brilliant [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) and a fantastic set of [introductory tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) on their website. These notes are heavily indebted to those introductory tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter uses the **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **numpy** packages. If you're running this code, you may need to install these packages, which you can do using either `conda install packagename` or `pip install packagename` on your computer's command line. (If you're not sure what a command line or terminal is, take a quick look at the basics of coding chapter.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using tidy data\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, if you're working with tabular data, it's good to try and use a so-called 'tidy data' format. This is data with one observation per row, and one variable per column, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidy data aren't going to be appropriate *every* time and in every case, but they're a really, really good default for tabular data. Once you use it as your default, it's easier to think about how to perform subsequent operations. Some plotting libraries, such as **seaborn**, take that youre data are in tidy format as a given. And many operations that you can perform on dataframes (the objects that hold tabular data within many programming languages) are easier when you have tidy data. If you're are writing out data to file to share, putting it in tidy format is a really good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, *getting* your messy dataset into a tidy format may take a bit of work... but we're about to enter the exciting world of coding for data analysis and the tools you'll see in the rest of this chapter will help you to 'wrangle' even the most messy of datasets."

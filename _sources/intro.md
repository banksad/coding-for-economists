# Introduction

Welcome to **coding for economists**, a guide for economists on what programming is, why it's useful, and how to do it.

The book aims to give you the skills you need to code for economics, while also giving you bits and pieces of information about programming more generally that might be useful to you. It's suitable for complete beginniners who have never written any code before. Some of the later chapters are suitable for people who have coded before too.

Naturally, at times, I have made choices regarding what to include, what to omit, and what to recommend. I have given recommendations based on what will serve you best in the long-run. Very occasionally, like the Karate Kid painting Mr Miyagi's fence, you will wonder why such and such a thing is useful for coding in an economics context. But, also like the Karate Kid, you will find that you weren't *just* learning to paint a fence, you were becoming a karate (coding) master.

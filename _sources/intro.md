Welcome to **coding for economists**, a guide for economists on what programming is, why it's useful, and how to do it.

The book aims to give you the skills you need to code for economics, while also giving you bits and pieces of information about programming more generally that might be useful to you. It's suitable for complete beginners who have never written any code before. Some of the later chapters are suitable for people who have coded before too.

Naturally, at times, I have made choices regarding what to include, what to omit, and what to recommend. I have given recommendations based on what will serve you best in the long-run. Very occasionally, like the Karate Kid painting Mr Miyagi's fence, you will wonder why such and such a thing is useful for coding in an economics context. But, also like the Karate Kid, you will find that you weren't *just* learning to paint a fence, you were becoming a karate (coding) master.

## What is coding?

Computer programming, or coding, is the process of issuing a series of commands that a computer can understand and execute in order to perform a task. Today, almost all research with some quantitative aspect involves coding.

Imagine a computer as being like a particularly mischievous genie; if your instructions aren't completely unambiguous, the computer won't do what you asked for. So we write out our code, our list of instructions for the computer, very explicitly to make sure *we* can check we wrote what we meant, and that the computer will do it in the way we anticipate. Like a genie though, if you can get the instructions just so, you can create magical things.

## Why should economists learn to code?

Given so much of economics is quantitative, coding is an essential skill for many economists. Many of the tools and packages that have been developed will help you to do better work more productively. It's Pareto improving.

As a skill, programming is enormously valuable *beyond economics* too because it's used across a wide range of domains (this is especially true for general purpose programming languages). Code is widely used across industry, academia, and the public sector in everything from computer games to websites, data science to software applications. And learning basic programming concepts in any language is useful for almost any other programming language. So learning to code is good for your human capital.

Coding is like a superpower; it's both fun and powerful! Head to the first section to get started.

## How to use this book

Pages that have code on can be downloaded and run as *Jupyter Notebooks*. Click the download symbol in the top right hand corner of the page and select '.ipynb', which stands for 'ipython notebook'. To run downloaded notebooks, just open them directly in Visual Studio Code (see the instructions in the Preliminaries chapter for more on installing Visual Studio Code). For notebooks that you download and run on your own computer, you may need to install additional software packages. You can also import these notebooks into Google Colab and run them there.

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip
Every page with code can be downloaded and run as a Jupyter notebook--just click <i class="fas fa-download"></i> at the top of the page and select '.ipynb'.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you'll see how to make plots that present data in an engaging and informative way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a plethora of options (and packages) for data visualisation using code. First, though a note about the different *philosophies* of data visualisation. There are broadly two categories of approach to using code to create data visualisations: *imperative*, where you build what you want, and *declarative*, where you say what you want. Choosing which to use involves a trade-off: imperative libraries offer you flexibility but at the cost of some verbosity; declarative libraries offer you a quick way to plot your data, but only if it's in the right format to begin with, and customisation may be more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this chapter, we'll take a look at making visualisations with several of these libraries. But first, let's introduce them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important and widely used data visualisation library in Python is [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/). It was used to make the first image of a black hole {cite}`bhpaper` and to image the first empirical evidence of gravitational waves {cite}`gwpaper`. **matplotlib** is an imperative visualisation library: you specify each part of what you want individually to build up an entire picture. It's perhaps the easiest to get started with and the most difficult to master. As well as making plots, it can also be used to make diagrams, animations, and 3D visualisations (which you should use sparingly, if at all).\n",
    "\n",
    "[**seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) is a popular declarative library that builds on **maplotlib** and works especially well with data that are in a *tidy* format (one row per observation, one column per variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "[**plotnine**](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is another declarative plotting library but, rather than having lots of different functions (eg 'boxplot', 'violinplot', 'scatterplot') as **seaborn** does, it adopts a *grammar of graphics* approach. What this means is that *all* visualisations begin with the same command, `ggplot`, and are combinations of layers that address different aspects of a plot, for example points or lines, scale, labels, and so on. It's a bit difficult to grasp this idea in the abstract, but we'll see a concrete example soon enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**altair**](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is yet another declarative plotting library for Python! It's most suited to interactive graphics on the web, and produces really beautiful charts. Under the hood, it calls a javascript library named **Vega-Lite** that's the sort of thing newspaper data visualisation units might use to make their infographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pandas** also has built-in plotting functions that you will have seen in the data analysis part of this book. They are of the form `df.plot.*` where `*` could be, for example, `scatter`. These are convenience functions for making a quick plot of your data and they actually use **matplotlib**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to start this chapter by finding out a little bit more about each of these data visualisation libraries before looking at some examples of how to make specific plots with all the main libraries. We'll end by looking at some more interesting and advanced plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these libraries has their own default theme for how it shows plots. Personally, I'm not much of a fan of the **matplotlib** default so the first thing I do is to change it to something more aesthetically pleasing and that uses the kind of fonts you'll see in a paper compiled with latex."

Of course, most of the time you're likely only to have one axis per figure, but in the cases when you don't it's a really useful setup. The plotting of elements such as lines, points, bars, and so, are controlled by the `ax` objects while the overall settings are controlled by `fig`.\n",
